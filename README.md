# Ball-blast

A simple replica of the Ball Blast game, built using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS. The game is inspired by the popular Android game **Ball Blast**. Just clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser to play the game.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to shoot and destroy the falling balls with your cannon. Each ball has a number that decreases as you shoot it, and when the number reaches zero, the ball is destroyed. As you progress, the balls get larger and tougher to break. Avoid getting hit by the balls to stay alive!

### Controls:
- **Move Cannon**: Use the arrow keys (←, →) to move the cannon left and right.
